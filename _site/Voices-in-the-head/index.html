Steganography is a method used for hiding information in files, in this case, WAV files. Using a Xiao Steganography decoder, we notice that there is a ZIP file hidden in the WAV file.Upon attempting to extract the files, we realize that the ZIP file is invalid. When viewed in a hex editor, the file signature is incorrect as it does not correspond to a ZIP file as seen from this website. For those new to CTFs, all files contain a file signature - a fixed pattern of bytes to begin the file, sometimes called magic bytes.Edit: The Gary Kessler website may have been taken down.

<p>This is code written in the brainf*ck programming language, notorious for its minimalism. Running this code on an <a href="https://copy.sh/brainfuck/">online compiler</a> yields the text <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thisisnottheflag</code>. Welp, looks like a dead end.</p>

<p>After awhile, due to the challenge title not being sufficiently clear, the following hint was given: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Xiao wants to help.

<p>Xiao is a reference to Xiao Steganography. Steganography is a method used for hiding information in files, in this case, WAV files. Using a <a href="https://download.cnet.com/Xiao-Steganography/3000-2092_4-10541494.html">Xiao Steganography decoder</a>, we notice that there is a ZIP file hidden in the WAV file.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dRBaVrr.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Upon attempting to extract the files, we realize that the ZIP file is invalid. When viewed in a hex editor, the file signature is incorrect as it does not correspond to a ZIP file as seen from <a href="https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html">this website</a>. For those new to CTFs, all files contain a file signature - a fixed pattern of bytes to begin the file, sometimes called magic bytes.</p>

<p>Edit: The Gary Kessler website may have been taken down. You can access the archived website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201111234459/https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hence, I suspected that the file was encrypted using the Xiao Steganography password field. But what could the password be?</p>

<p>The only string we’ve got is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thisisnottheflag</code> from the brainf*ck code. When this was input into the password field and the ZIP file was extracted, we could finally obtain a valid ZIP file</p>

<h2 id="extracting-the-zip-contents">Extracting the ZIP contents</h2>
<p>While attempting to extract the ZIP, a password was requested. Since trying the same password (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thisisnottheflag</code>) doesn’t work, looks like we don’t have a password this time. What if the password was stored in plaintext, such as in a comment, in the ZIP? Running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strings</code> would return the following:</p>

<p>Similar to the previous string, since they tell you that that text is NOT the flag, it’s most likely the password for the ZIP. Lo and behold, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">govtech-csg{Th1sisn0ty3tthefl@g}</code> as the password extracts all the contents of the ZIP.
