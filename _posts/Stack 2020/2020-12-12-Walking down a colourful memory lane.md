## Challenge Description
>We are trying to find out how did our machine get infected. What did the user do?

## Memory Analysis
We are given a `.mem` file (Memory dump). We can use the premier tool for memory forensics [volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility). In my 2 weeks of memory forensics experience, I found that as [volatility3](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3) is rather new, I prefer to stick to volatility (python2) due to the wealth of available plugins. Note that on my machine, I've set up an alias `vol` for `python vol.py`.

For those who are using volatility for your first time, the format for each command is `vol -f <file> <plugin/command>`

From previous CTFs, I follow a standard procedure (assuming it is a Windows machine which is typical of many CTFs), running `imagescan` then `pslist`. This is a very good starting point as it gives an idea of the machine profile. Think of profiles as a type of Windows machine (ie Windows7, WindowsXP, etc). 
```
$ vol -f forensics-challenge-1.mem imageinfo
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
INFO    : volatility.debug    : Determining profile based on KDBG search...
          Suggested Profile(s) : Win7SP1x64, Win7SP0x64, Win2008R2SP0x64, Win2008R2SP1x64_24000, Win2008R2SP1x64_23418, Win2008R2SP1x64, Win7SP1x64_24000, Win7SP1x64_23418
.
.
.
```
We can choose the first suggested profile, then run `pslist` to check that the profile chosen works well. Remember to append `--profile=<chosen_profile>` in each volatility command now. `pslist` would return the entire process list.
```
$ vol -f forensics-challenge-1.mem --profile=Win7SP1x64 pslist

From experience, we can see 2 suspicious processes `notepad` (commonly used as a target in other CTFs) and `chrome` (exceptionally large number of chrome processes). I decided to explore chrome first as it is very suspicious to have such a large number of Google Chrome processes. 

## Analyzing chrome.exe
To analyze a Google Chrome history, we can use the `filescan` and `dumpfiles` plugins, followed by using `sqlitebrowser` to view the chrome history. More can be read up on part 9 in [this writeup](https://medium.com/hackstreetboys/hsb-presents-otterctf-2018-memory-forensics-write-up-c3b9e372c36c). 

Alternatively, we can install the `chromehistory` plugin from https://github.com/superponible/volatility-plugins. If your volatility was compiled from source, you can copy the plugin files into `volatility/volatility/plugins` rather than passing the `--plugins=<directory>` argument. This makes it easier to install plugins though it can get very messy if you wish to uninstall them so I only advise to do this if you really want the convenience of installing plugins which you KNOW work.

Most of the websites here are fluff as one could tell from random Google searches and going to STACK conference website homepage. However, 2 lines caught my attention:
```

A PNG file from mediafire. Looking back at the challenge name, we realize that colors could refer to images like this one. 

## Analyzing the PNG
If we look at the PNG - well - you can't really see it as it is tiny. In case the image is too hard to see, I'll describe it: a small line of colored then black pixels. Initially, I thought it was colored text in a terminal. However, after downloading the image, further inspection by viewing image properties showed that it was a 64x1 pixel image.

After some thought, I noticed that it was a line of colored pixels, followed by a line of black pixels. The RGB values of black is (0,0,0). We can consider the fact that the RGB values of each pixel correspond to ASCII values representing the flag.

To convert the image to RGB values, one could simple search PNG to RGB and find [this website](https://convertio.co/png-rgb/). Opening the output file in a hex editor or simply running the UNIX `cat` on the it would produce the flag.

However, the real technical term for a similar file is a bitmap (.BMP). An uncompressed bitmap file represents its bits in RGB but in 3 byte [little endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) (BGR instead of RGB) which may make it harder to read. Nonetheless, using a hex editor, one can decode the flag after converting from PNG to BMP as well.

Yet another alternative, if you are more familiar with tools, is to use [zsteg](https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg) which is able to produce different steganographic outputs, including lowest significant bit (LSB) and RGB bytes.
```
