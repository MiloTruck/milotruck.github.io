A local Singaporean CTF organized by HCI for JC students, in collaboration with DCO and CSIT. I participated with my teammates in **ItzyBitzySpider**, under the name **acsi-1**. We managed to place 3rd in the end, and were also awarded **Winner of Data Science Category** for the most challenge in the Data Science category. 

Sadly, I didn't do any writeups since this competition during my exam period :(
