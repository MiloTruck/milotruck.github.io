A local Singaporean CTF hosted by GovTech, where we managed to place 3rd under the name **ItzyBitzySpider**. I participated in this CTF with my regular teammates in the JC category, [@jloh02](https://jloh02.github.io/), [@OceanKoh](http://blog.puddle.sg), [@NyxTo](https://github.com/Nyxto). Many of the writeups below were written by them, so credits to them.
