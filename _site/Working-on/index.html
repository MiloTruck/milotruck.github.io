We can view his profile on gitlab using this link. We can confirm that we are on the right path as we see several projects with “KoroVax” in them, suggesting that this user was indeed created for the purpose of the CTF.At this stage, we viewed all the repositories and projects he created/imported trying to find any clues. However, majority of them were empty. The only anomaly out of his entire activity was the commit which contained changes in the project README. We canclick on the commit ID to view more details about it.Upon closer inspection, we see that in the Todo, there is a point about how not all repositories should be public. From this, we can guess that the repository that we are searching for is private. However, just above that, there is also another point which notes that Josh (our target) is in charge of krs-admin-portal. This seems suspicious. Perhaps it may be a repository name?

<p>Opening the link provided, there is nothing that stands out at first glance. Since the flag is a repository name, we know we have to find some sort of clue that is related. Perhaps there is something we can find in the page source.</p>

<p>Upon closer inspection, we see that in the Todo, there is a point about how not all repositories should be public. From this, we can guess that the repository that we are searching for is private.
