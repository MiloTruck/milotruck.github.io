I"J<p>A local Singaporean CTF organized by HCI for JC students, in collaboration with DCO and CSIT. I participated with my teammates in <strong>ItzyBitzySpider</strong>, under the name <strong>acsi-1</strong>. We managed to place 3rd in the end, and were also awarded <strong>Winner of Data Science Category</strong> for the most challenge in the Data Science category.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t do any writeups since this competition was hosted too near to my examinations :(</p>
