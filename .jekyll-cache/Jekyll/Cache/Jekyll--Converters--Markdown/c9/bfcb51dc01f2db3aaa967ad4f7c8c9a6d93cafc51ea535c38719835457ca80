I"h<p>A Singaporean CTF locally hosted by DSO National Laboratories and the Nationa University of Singapore (NUS). I played this CTF with my regular teammate, <a href="https://blog.puddle.sg/">@OceanKoh</a>, under the name <strong>It’z Me</strong>. We managed to get 6th place, which I’m quite satisified with. Not bad for the first official CTF of 2021.</p>
