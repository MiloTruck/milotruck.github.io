I" <p>A local Singaporean CTF organized by HCI for JC students, in collaboration with DCO and CSIT. I participated with my teammates in <strong>ItzyBitzySpider</strong>, under the name <strong>acsi-1</strong>. We managed to place 3rd in the end, and were also awarded <strong>Winner of Data Science Category</strong> for the most challenge solves in Data Science. Unfortunately, no writeups cause this competition was during my exam period :(</p>
