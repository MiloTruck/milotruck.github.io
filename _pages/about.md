I'm an independent security researcher who specializes in blockchain and EVM security. Currently, I work as a Senior Auditor at [Trust Security](https://www.trust-security.xyz/) and Associate Security Researcher at [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/).

I'm also a top warden at [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/), where I regularly participate in audit contests. I occasionally hunt for live bugs on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/) in my spare time as well.
