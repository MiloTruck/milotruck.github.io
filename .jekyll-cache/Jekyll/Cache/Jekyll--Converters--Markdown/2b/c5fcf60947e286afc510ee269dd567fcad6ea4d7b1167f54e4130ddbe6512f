<h2 id="challenge-description">Challenge Description</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>We heard a rumor that COVID was leveraging that smart city‚Äôs ‚Äòlight‚Äô technology for communication. Find out in detail on the technology and what is being transmitted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="initial-analysis">Initial Analysis</h2>
<p>We are given a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.logicdata</code> file. After some research, we find that it is a capture output from a Saleae logic analyzer. Essentially, the deivce logs the output of digital/analog pins.</p>

<p>From the challenge description, we know that it is a communication between 2 devices.</p>

<p>Opening the file in the <a href="https://support.saleae.com/logic-software/legacy-software/latest-stable-release-download">Saleae Logic Analyzer software</a> (hence forth referred to as Saleae), we find that only a single channel/wire is used to transmit data. Note: for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.logicdata</code> files, only Saleae version 1 can be used.</p>

<h2 id="about-communication-protocols">About Communication Protocols</h2>
<p>If you are only concerned with the solution and already have some basic knowledge of hardware protocols, feel free to skip this section.</p>

<p>Since this challenge is in the IoT category, I figured I should provide a brief background about communication protocols. In order for 2 devices to send data to each other, a protocol has to be established, similar to typical network transmission protocols, but at a hardware level. Usually, the data line is digital (0 or 1). This is true for this challenge as the data being sent is ‚Äúlight communication‚Äù.</p>

<p>Examples of common protocols are Serial UART and I2C (pronounced I-squared-C). You can read up on them on your own. But most of them have a pretty standard format: header, address (if more than 2 devices), message length, message. This forms the basis of my initial solution.</p>

<p>Coming from a robotics background, I am familiar with hardware protocols, even <a href="https://github.com/jloh02/SICC">coding one based off the I2C protocol recently</a>. I will discuss 2 key ideas that are seen in many protocols: Clocks and packet structures.</p>

<p>In every data transmission, in order to differentiate multiple consecutive bits of the same value (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1111</code>) a clock is usually established. In systems with more than 1 wire, the clock line (SCL in I2C or CLK) alternates between 0 and 1. Since the system given uses 1 wire, there must be a fixed clock rate, making it easier to read our data as we do not have to worry about rising and falling edges on our clock line.</p>

<p>There is also typically a fixed packet structure. In I2C, it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;packet header&gt;&lt;address&gt;&lt;length&gt;&lt;data&gt;</code></p>
<ul>
  <li>The header can simply be a HIGH signal to start the data transmission</li>
  <li>Addresses are used in systems with multiple devices</li>
  <li>Length is the string length of the data. Alternatively, some systems may prefer a fixed packet length or a terminator (fixed string to determine end of sequence)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-initial-solution">My Initial Solution</h2>
<p>If you are uninterested in my failed almost unimportant attempts, skip this section. However, note that skipping this section also assumes you have used the Saleae software before or can figure it out on your own.</p>

<p>Of course, the easiest way to start this challenge is to try all the different analyzers (right panel). That didn‚Äôt work. So I proceeded to analyze the data packets manually.</p>

<p>As seen below, each packet begins with a long HIGH, a long LOW, followed by a sequence of HIGHs and LOWs of fixed width (clock timing has been established). It is interesting to note how a HIGH also has LOWs beside it which does not occur in many protocols.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XDPH9nv.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Scrolling in on each HIGH reveals that it is an oscillating signal, making it even harder for certain analyzers to read.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AazRe8w.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thus, I decided to write a python script to parse the data. The data can be exported to via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">options &gt; Export data</code>. I assumed the following to be the headers (including addresses): <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;long HIGH&gt;&lt;long LOW&gt;1111111110101010101010101</code>. Anything after would form the data. I then interpreted the data. For the above image, it would‚Äôve been <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">101011101010110111</code>. I also assumed a fixed packet length, padding each packet to a multiple of 8 bits. However, converting this to ASCII didn‚Äôt work, even if I used a 7-bit ASCII instead.</p>

<p>It was at this point I realized my approach was probably wrong. The challenge must be telling something else.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-solution">The Real Solution</h2>
<p>It dawned upon me that light protocol could refer to an infrared light protocol (NEC IR). I googled about the NEC IR protocol and out came this image.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l32xeKe.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Bingo! This looks EXACTLY like what we are given!</p>

<p>In each NEC IR packet, the value of each bit is determined by the time between 2 HIGHs. A long 9ms HIGH and 4.5ms LOW signals the start. Followed by the address and its logical inverse, and then the data and its logical inverse for verification.</p>

<p>The Saleae Logic Analyzer software does not officially support the NEC IR protocol so if I wanted to use the software‚Äôs analyzer, I would‚Äôve had to download the Saleae SDK and import a <a href="https://github.com/LiveOverflow/NECAnalyzer">library</a>. I also figured that since each ‚ÄúHIGH‚Äù contains multiple oscillations of HIGHs and LOWs, this may introduce errors. Instead, we can export the data to a CSV and use a Python script to decode the data whilst ignoring the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AazRe8w.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In addition, we notice that the last quarter of the data packets given are not an exact logical inverse of the 3rd quarter. This means the data in our capture does not exactly correspond to the original NEC IR specifications. So perhaps using a script to parse this data is simpler than trying to make an existing analyzer work.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XDPH9nv.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Using the Python script below, the bits of the data can be extracted including the headers and addresses. Thresholds for headers and timings between bits could be empirically derived from Saleae in case the transmission does not directly correspond to the original NEC IR specifications.</p>

<p>Since the address and its logical inverse is consistent throughout (only 1 destination address), the header, address and inverse address can be removed. I used a simple find and replace in a text editor to remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10000000011111111</code>. The first 2 lines can also be excluded since they are null bytes.</p>
