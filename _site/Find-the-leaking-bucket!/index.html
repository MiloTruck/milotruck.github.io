Find that hidden S3 bucket (in the format “word1-word2-s4fet3ch”) and find out what was exfiltrated!There doesn’t seem to be any obvious way to find out the leaking bucket. So we decided to brute force to find out. With only 2 words to guess, brute force doesn’t seem unreasonable.Visiting the company site, we are greeted with a word cloud. The most obvious solution was to use these words in the word cloud, however, we couldn’t find the bucket with that alone (if only it were that simple…)At this stage, we thought we needed to come up with our own words. To facilitate this I uploaded the script to our team EC2 instance which we set up in preparation for this ctf. There, we just kept adding words that we thought of including text from images on the website. With the new wordlist, we ran the script again.This allowed us to find the bucket: think-innovation-s4fet3chWhile the script was running, we managed to confirm with admin that all words could be found on the website. But by then, we had already found the bucket.

When we try to unzip the files, we are prompted for a password (nani???). Immediately we thought of cracking the zip. With a few simple commands, we already got JTR brute forcing the zip. But after running it for a few second, we already sorta knew this wasn’t the solution. If JTR wasn’t able to insta-crack it with rockyou.txt, it’s quite safe to say the password is strong.

<p>There doesn’t seem to be any obvious way to find out the leaking bucket. So we decided to brute force to find out. With only 2 words to guess, brute force doesn’t seem unreasonable.</p>

<p>Visiting the company site, we are greeted with a word cloud. The most obvious solution was to use these words in the word cloud, however, we couldn’t find the bucket with that alone (if only it were that simple…)</p>

<p>At this stage, we thought we needed to come up with our own words. To facilitate this I uploaded the script to our team EC2 instance which we set up in preparation for this ctf.

<p>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aws cli</code>, we can easily view the contents of the bucket with the  command:

<p>Why is there an extra document there??? Looks like it was left there on purpose. It is a file that participants under 18 must fill up to join the CTF, we encountered it during registration, and we knew we could download a copy. So we know</p>

<ol>
  <li>The zip contains 2 files with both encrypted</li>
